Lightning Web Components (LWC) is an enterprise-grade web components foundation for building user interfaces. LWC provides a simple authoring format for UI components, which is compiled into low-level Web Component APIs. The `lwc` package is the main entry point for dependencies.

-   Develop components quickly and declaratively using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
-   Develop accessible components so that everyone can understand and navigate your app.
-   Components are encapsulated in Shadow DOM, with the `@lwc/synthetic-shadow` package as an optional polyfill for older browsers.

Developing a Lightning web component is this easy:

```ascii
counter
  ├──counter.css
  ├──counter.html
  └──counter.js
```

```html
<!-- counter.html -->
<template>
    <p>Counter: {count}</p>
    <button onclick="{increaseCounter}">Add</button>
</template>
```

```css
/* counter.css */
p {
    font-family: serif;
    font-size: large;
}
```

```javascript
// counter.js
import { LightningElement } from 'lwc';

export default class Counter extends LightningElement {
    count = 0;

    increaseCounter() {
        this.count += 1;
    }
}
```
