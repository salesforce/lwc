# ACTCompiler components

These components are copied over from the ACTCompiler's unit tests (`ActToCompilerDataConverterUnitTest.java`).
They correspond to the dev versions of the output compiler code.

To make these easier to work with in the tests, they are also wrapped in functions that take a `define` argument.
