# ACT compiler components

These components are copied over from the ACT compiler's unit tests (`ActToCompilerDataConverterUnitTest.java`).
They correspond to the dev versions of the output compiler code.

To make these easier to work with in the tests, they are also wrapped in functions that take a `define` argument.

Don't update the content in this folder unless the ACT compiler's output is updated.

You can find more detail about the strategy in W-14210248.
