/**
 * We have two modes for creating custom elements:
 *
 * 1. Compat (legacy) browser support (e.g. IE11). Totally custom, doesn't rely on native browser APIs.
 * 2. "Upgradable constructor" custom element. This allows us to have two LWC components with the same tag name,
 *    via a trick: every custom element constructor we define in the registry is basically the same. It's essentially
 *    a dummy `class extends HTMLElement` that accepts an `upgradeCallback` in its constructor ("upgradable
 *    constructor"), which allows us to have completely customized functionality for different components.
