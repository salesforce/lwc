# LWC Engine

lwc-engine is a private package that handles the run-time for `lwc`. This package shouldn't be used directly, as all usage should go through `lwc` instead.

This packgage includes:
 - Synthetic Shadow DOM
 - Diffing Algo
 - Accessibility Polyfill (AOM)
 - Native Shadow DOM support

### Dependencies

`lwc-engine` does not include any external run-time dependencies. There are a few "dependencies" that we've manually imported, but it should be noted that this code has been heavilty modified and has little resemblance to the original public code.
 - Snabbdom
    - Our diffing library for DOM nodes.
    - src/3rdparty/snabbdom
 - Polymer
    - Shadow DOM polyfills
